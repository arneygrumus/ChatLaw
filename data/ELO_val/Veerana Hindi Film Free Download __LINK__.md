The film begins with a young boy being sacrificed by a group of priests to revive Nakita, who appears as a beautiful woman but transforms into a hideous creature when she removes her bat locket. Thakur Mahender Pratap Singh, a local landlord, learns about the witch's terror and decides to investigate. His brother Sameer encounters Nakita in the forest and manages to capture her by snatching her locket. The villagers hang her to death, but her spirit escapes and enters Jasmin, the daughter of Sameer's friend. Jasmin grows up to be a stunning woman, but she is controlled by Nakita, who makes her seduce and kill men in the forest. Mahender Pratap's son Sahil returns from abroad and falls in love with Jasmin, unaware of her dark secret. He also faces opposition from his cousin Vikram, who wants to marry Jasmin for her wealth.

The Ramsay Brothers were inspired to make horror films after they noticed that a scene in their film Ek Nanhi Munni Ladki Thi (1970), where Prithviraj Kapoor wears a devil's mask to scare Mumtaz, was well-received by the audience. They decided to experiment with a full-fledged horror film called Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche (1972), which was a surprise hit and launched their career in the genre. They also created a successful TV series called Zee Horror Show in the 1990s, which featured different stories of horror and suspense every week.
