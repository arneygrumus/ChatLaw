# Asi Profile Inventor: A Powerful Tool for Designing Steel and Aluminum Structures
 
Asi Profile Inventor is a plug-in application for Autodesk Inventor that enables efficient parametric design of steel and aluminum structures, solutions for their connecting elements and automatic generation of reports. It is developed by ITB Paul Schneider, a German company that has been certified by Autodesk since Inventor version 5.
 
Asi Profile Inventor offers functions for easy placement and modification of 3D profiles. A profile can be drawn between given points, along a 2D or 3D sketch curve, to a surface or with a fixed length. Lengths, connection properties and other parameters are maintained in a clear table form and can be applied to other profiles and their connections. There are functions for creating different types of 3D grids (space, isometry), functions for labeling and naming profiles (database), editing functions for working with profiles (shortening/extending, rotating, tightening, chamfering...), functions for solving different types of profile connections, drilling fields, predefined database of typical connections (including DASt), generated bills of materials, Excel-driven parametric designs.

Structures, assemblies and bills of materials created using Asi Profile Inventor remain compatible with the standard version of Inventor and can be normally used for subsequent design work. Asi Profile Inventor helps to streamline the work of steel structure designers and other metal structures and products in various fields. Together with Autodesk Inventor, you get a tool for designing steel structures from initial design to production and assembly.

## Benefits of using Asi Profile Inventor over Advanced Steel
 
Advanced Steel is another software solution for designing steel structures, but it is based on AutoCAD and not Inventor. While both products have their advantages and disadvantages, there are some reasons why you might prefer using Asi Profile Inventor over Advanced Steel.
 
One of the main benefits of using Asi Profile Inventor is that you can leverage the full power of Inventor's 3D modeling capabilities, parametric features, data management and interoperability with other Autodesk products. You can also use standard Inventor commands to modify or complete the parts and assemblies created with Asi Profile Inventor, as they are native compatible Inventor objects. This gives you more flexibility and control over your design process and allows you to create more complex and customized structures.
 
Another benefit of using Asi Profile Inventor is that you can easily integrate it with your existing Inventor workflows and projects. You don't need to switch between different software platforms or learn a new user interface. You can access all the functions of Asi Profile Inventor from the Inventor menu and use the same look and feel as those of Inventor. You can also share your files and data with other Inventor users without any compatibility issues.
 
A third benefit of using Asi Profile Inventor is that you can benefit from the support and expertise of Mensch und Maschine, the leading supplier of CAD/CAM/CAE solutions in Europe. Mensch und Maschine is an authorized partner for support and sales of Asi Profile Inventor in Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. They offer training, consulting and technical assistance for Asi Profile Inventor users and can help you get the most out of this powerful tool.
